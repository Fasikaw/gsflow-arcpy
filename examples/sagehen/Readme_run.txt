If getting the following error then you need to add 'python' in your envrionmental variables.  

error: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

To enter the path for python to your environmental variables go to:

control panel > system > advanced > |Environmental Variables| > system variables -> Path                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                            
this needs to include: C:\Python26; (or equivalent).
                                                                                                                                                                            
Then restart your prompt, and try typing 'python'.

The other option is to remove the 'python' from each command line in the batch file. 

This has been done for the alternate batch file called 'runscripts_python_removed.bat.
